					  <h1>Talking tyres with Tottenham Hotspur. Kumho visits their state-of-the-art sports facility.</h1>
					  <p>Kumho   recently capitalised on its unique relationship as Official Tyre   Partner to Tottenham Hotspur by holding an all-embracing conference for   some of its key customers at the Premier League football club&rsquo;s new   stadium.</p>

					  <p>The day included presentations by senior company personnel   and key suppliers, and the subjects covered included TyreSafe, the   industry charity Kumho has supported since its inception. There was also   the opportunity to meet some Spurs legends and tour the   state-of-the-art sports facility.</p>
					  <p>Commenting on the occasion, Kumho UK&rsquo;s Marketing Director   John Thrupp said: &ldquo;The high-tech surroundings provided the perfect   backdrop for a discussion about Kumho&rsquo;s innovative products and, with   our Performance Partner network growing steadily year-on-year, it was   very timely to remind the assembled representatives of the parent   company&rsquo;s establishment (it celebrates its 60th anniversary   this year), global footprint, extensive research and development   facilities spanning three continents, and ever-growing range of products   for OE and aftermarket fitment.&rdquo;</p>
