					<h1>Sixth Place Finish for Tony Jardine and Dominic Tobin at WRGB </h1>
					<p>Pushing up through the places during the final three stages of the Wales Rally GB, an incredible sixth-place finish for Motor Sport Digital Editor, Dominic Tobin and motorsport media man, Tony Jardine. </p>
                        <p>Delighted after his debut, Tobin explained how he enjoyed his first rally experience. </p>

                          <p class="mb-0"><strong>&ldquo;It has been such an amazing adventure, I barely   looked up for the entire rally but I&rsquo;ve enjoyed it immensely. From the   outside looking in rallying seems so hectic, but in the cockpit, despite   the car sliding this way and that way it&rsquo;s all so controlled, it has   been a real eye-opener and an incredible experience.&rdquo;</strong></p>

                        <p>Undeterred by the immense downpour   over Llandudno during the rally. Spirits were high as the team powered   through – despite Tony Jardine claiming he was going to  &ldquo;take it easy&rdquo;   just the day before. </p>
                        <p>Regardless of the puncture suffered   prior to race day, the team put in fantastic times on three of the most   challenging stages. Finally celebrating their result after a two and a   half-hour drive to the finish, Tony gave his thoughts on the day: </p>

                          <p><strong>&ldquo;He (Tobin) was brilliant. An incredible debut, to come in at this   level and read the notes like a pro is nothing short of amazing. I   never had to say &lsquo;slow down&rsquo; or &lsquo;speed up&rsquo;, everything was on the money.   I&rsquo;m so pleased, the finish is better than I could have hoped for and   the effort of the entire team and sponsors has been incredible.&rdquo;</strong></p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>We are incredibly proud sponsors and have loved watching the Jardine/Tobin journey thus far. Great job boys! </p>
